# Numerical Methods

This repository contains implementations of numerical methods like method of moments, rayliegh and finite elements describe from textbooks and articles. Mostly applied to electromagnetic problems.

## Rayleigh

in Rayleigh directory there are implementations of rayleigh method to find TE modes in waveguide.

## Method of Moments

In methodo of moments   directory there are implementions of method of moments applied to reveal charge distribuition of a plate where a constant voltage is applied.
